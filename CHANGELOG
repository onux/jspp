* Fixed "this" keyword to refer to current instance of a class
* "super" keyword and related tests are now working
* Bug fixes

10/25/11 - Alpha 0.12
--------
* Fully typed ES3
* #typesys strict will look up properties
* #typesys strict will look up the prototype chain
* #typesys strict is compatible with typed ES3
* Property assignments are saved by compiler
* Started parsing nullable types, "is" keyword
* Bug fixes to #typesys strict and classes

10/10/11 - Alpha 0.11
--------
* Fixed parsing of rest parameters as first parameter
* Redeclaration of function parameters with let now works properly
* Static class members are now looked up properly
* Fixed bug where class members were being looked up outside of class

10/7/11
-------
* Added compiler.html - web page to invoke compiler
* Fixed bugs with destructuring assignments and block scoping

10/3/11
-------
* Parses and compiles all regular JavaScript tokens now
* Added exponent operator
* Added heredocs and multi-line strings

10/2/11
-------
* #typesys strict handles functions and function calls
* #typesys strict handles typed arrays (StringArray et al - NOT WebGL typed arrays)

10/1/11
-------
* Added type inference to object declarations in #typesys strict
	Example: var a as Object = {
				 foo: "foo", //inferred as String
				 bar: 1 //inferred as Number
			 };
	Easier to compose instead of declaring a type for each property.

9/30/11
-------
* Created type system: #typesys strict (Strong, static typing)

9/23/11
-------
* Added array comprehensions
* Added array operators, e.g. [1, 2, 3] *= 5

9/15/11
-------
* Added pluggable type systems
* Added es5.js to standard library to allow for array extras et al

9/1/11

* Added block scoping
* Added implicit RegExp.prototype.exec as implemented in SpiderMonkey/v8.  Example: /foo/("foo")
* Added custom regex delimiters
* Added regex comments
* Added regex free spacing mode with "x" flag (ignores whitespace, comments)
