"Code file" and "code files" in this document refers to electronic files 
containing instructions for computer(s) or computer program(s).

Each individual code file should contain a license block specifying permissions 
and licenses.  In the absence of such a license block, refer to one of the 
following files - if present - in the code file's containing directory:

LICENSE
LICENSE.TXT
LICENSE.DOC
LICENCE
LICENCE.TXT
LICENCE.DOC

The above filenames are case-insensitive and are hereinafter referred to as the 
"License File."  If more than one License File is present in a single directory, 
the License File(s) are considered void.

The License File applies the license to all code files in the same directory but 
not to its subdirectories.

In the absence of a license block within a code file and the absence of a 
License File, all rights are effectively reserved by the copyright owner.
